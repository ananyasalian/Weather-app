Weather Application
This is a simple React-based weather application that displays the current weather and time based on the user's location. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and displays it in a visually appealing layout.

Features
Real-time Weather Data: The app fetches the current weather data based on the user's geographical location.
Geolocation Support: Uses the browser's Geolocation API to determine the user's current location.
Automatic Weather Updates: The weather data is refreshed every 10 minutes to ensure up-to-date information.

Project Structure

src/: This is the main directory containing all the React components, CSS files, and assets.
App.js: The main component that renders the CurrentLocation component.
index.js: The entry point for the React application.
currentLocation.js: Contains the logic for fetching and displaying the weather data based on the user's location.
forcast.js: Handles the display of weather forecast information (if implemented).
apiKeys.js: Stores the API key and base URL for OpenWeatherMap.
App.css: Contains the global styling for the application.
images/: Directory to store images like weather icons.


State Management

State is managed locally within the Weather component using React's useState and useEffect hooks. The state variables include:
lat and lon for storing latitude and longitude.
temperatureC, temperatureF, city, country, and other weather-related data.
The state is updated based on the user's location and refreshed every 10 minutes.
Interaction Between Front-End and Back-End
Front-End: The front-end is built using React. The main UI is rendered by the App component, which includes the CurrentLocation component responsible for displaying weather data.
API Interaction: The front-end interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API via fetch requests in the getWeather method of the Weather component. The API key and base URL are stored in the apiKeys.js file.
Geolocation: The application uses the Geolocation API to get the user's current location and passes it to the getWeather function to fetch weather data.
